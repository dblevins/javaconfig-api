== Abstract
{name} is a enterprise ready highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular, extensible and
injectable key/value based design.

_{name}_ hereby translates into 'in the middle', which is exactly, what configuration should be. It should be
in the middle between your code and your runtime.

NOTE: Alternative names could be _Mahkah=earth, Dakota=friend_ or _Orenda=magic force_.


== Proposal
{name} is a enterprise ready configuration solution based on an modular, extensible and
injectable key/value based design. The basic building block hereby are
*property providers* implementing a small and easily implementable subset of a
+Map<String,String>+. This simplicity comes with a long list of decent advantages
such as

* capability of easily being combined with each other using different combination
policies into new composite providers, e.g.
** _add-ignore:_ Add all entries to an existing provider, but ignore all entries already
   existing in the base provider.
** _add-override_ Add all entries to an existing provider, but override all entries already
   existing in the base provider with the values from the added provider.
** _add_distinct:_ Add all entries to an existing provider, but require that all keys are
   distinct, throwing a +ConfigExcepion+ if they are not.
** _intersection:_ create a provider with key/values identical in both participating providers.
** _union:_ Adding key/values from multiple providers, resolving conflicts by some policy
   (renaming, prefixing, ...).
** _filtering:_ Interpreting a second providers as a multi-valued filter matrix, filtering the
   based provider.
** ...
* capability of easily serialize data and therefore also support configuration management and
  remote configuration distribution solution.
* no intersection with existing standard, especially CDI in the Java EE context.
* Simplicity in use and implementation
* Unified representation of all kind of possible configuration data (low level, higher level
  functions are provided by the +Configuration+ abstraction.
* Ease of reuse of existing Java platform provided default properties formats (properties,
  xml-properties).

Properties can be read from files, classpath resources, or any accessible URI in any format.
Extensions (custom formats and resource locations) can be provided by according SPIs easily.

Additionally configuration providers can be implemented as _environment aware_, which allows
to dynamically returns different configuration trees, based on the current runtime environment.
Hereby the environment is as well based on a simple key/value model, which additionally supports
child/parent relations between environments.

Finally with +Configuration+ the API for configuration provides higher level
features, such as type safe access and functional extension points, By default supporting all common data types
from the Java platform, including a representation for configured collection data. Well defined extensions
allow to adapt any target type required, as well as easily support more advanced features such
as templates, secured views, multi-valued validation schemes, en-/decryption or other.

By default configuration (and property providers) are designed and implemented as indirectly
mutable types, providing thread-safe, unsynchronized and therefore fast access to configuration.
Mutabilty is ensured (if supported), by creation of a mutable _builder_ using a final +commit()+.
The API allows to listen to changes on a global as well as on a local, configuration based level.
It is also planned to support remote configuration change propagation scenarios.

== Background
There is a global initiative running now for about a year lead by Anatole Tresch (Credit Suisse)
with the target of standardizing configuration in Java EE and SE. Due to several reasons it
seems currently most sensible to start an OSS project on the topic to join forces that actively
want to contribute to the project. It is highly probably that standardization will be restarted
at a later point.
For further information you may look at his blog at javaeeconfig.blogspot.com .

== Rationale
Configuration is one of the most cross-cutting concerns, which still lacks of any standard, especially
beside Java EE. Nevertheless Java EE is currently (EE7) in most areas strictly only configurable during
build time of the deployed artifacts. Especially dynamic provisioning of resources or runtime configuration
is not supported and in many cases impossible to add without tweaking the underlying application server.
On the other hand running two separate configuration solutions for Java EE and Java SE as well make no or
little sense. So it would be important we have a unified configuration model at hand, that is flexible enough, so

* it can be used in Java SE and EE
* it can support contextual behaviour (like in Java EE and multi-tenancy/SaaS scenarios)
* it provides a uniform API, regardless, if its used in SE or EE scenarios
* it supports existing APIs, e.g. +System.getProperties, java.util.preferences+ in SE and +CDI, JNDI+ in Java EE
* it supports service location pattern like access as well as _injection_ of configured values.
* it is simple in use and easily extensible.
* it support integration with existing configuration solutions currently in use, both OSS as well as customized
  in-house proprietary solutions


== Initial Goals
There is an existing code base implementing a significant part of the features mentioned already at
https://github.com/java-config , which will be moved into the incubator.

== Current Status
There is an existing running code base implementing a significant part of the features mentioned already at
https://github.com/java-config and licensed under Apache v2.0, which will be contributed into the incubator.
The separation between API and implementation hereby should stay enforced, since

* it reflects the structure also required for later JSRs
* it enables to provide different implementations, especially also a Java ME compatible solution.

== Meritocracy
We plan to do everything possible to encourage an environment that supports a meritocracy. We did the same as well with
JSR 354, were people throughout the world helped us to get the RI/TCK at a very good level. Similarly, whenever
possible, we encouraged people to join the expert group, so they also would be capable of contributing to the
API directly. In all cases we discussed all questions amd feedback transparently regardless if it was an EG mebmer
or just a member of Hackday, Hackergarten.

== Community
The project initiative already is significantly supported by JUGs such as SouJava, LJC, iJUG, Berlin Brandenburg JUG,
JUG Zurich, as well as companies such as Credit Suisse and Walmart. It is expected that support will
raise very quickly so the library will evolve and be widely used as well.

== Core Developers
The core team will be a set of well known experts from the Java SE and EE area:

* _Anatole Tresch_ (Lead) is currently employed at Credit Suisse. He leads JSR 354 (Money & Currency) and also
  was planned as cospec lead for Java EE configuration JSR together with Oracle. He also is a member of the
  CDI 2.0 expert group and is actively driving the configuration topic during its talks at the conferences.
* _Werner Keil_ aka "Java Godfather" is individual JCP EC member contributing to several JSR's in the SE and EE area.
  He is spec lead of the Units and Measurements JSR. Werner is already a member of ASF.
* _Otávio Gonçalves de Santana_ is a member of _SouJava_ and OpenJDK committer. He contibutes regularly to several JSRs
  and recently was awarded in 2014 as most valuable JCP member.
* _Joe Pullen_ is a known expert, especially for JPA and Batch and also former EC member of the corresponding JSRs.
* _Ryan Mcguinness_ works as Senior Platform Architect for Walmart.

Other people will join for sure once the incubator is running.
* _LJC (London Java Community), SouJava,JUG Chennai_ will do Hackdays and provide feedback.
* _JUG Berlin Brandenburg_ is one of the bigger JUGs in Germany and would probably also actively contribute to this project.
* _JUG Zurich_ organizes regular (monthly) Hackergarten and will as well contribute to this project.

== Alignment
Credit Suisse, which lead the initiative through Anatole Tresch during the last year, has a strong commitment to
Open Source Software. As a consequence also their first JSR (354, Money & Currency) was released under Apache v2.
The same is the case for all other core contributors and supporters.

== Known Risks
Main Risk could be that main committers could cease the project before it is possible to build up a public community.
Nevertheless the wide support of JUGs and companies involved already as well as the engagement of main drivers of the
initiatives during the last year makes this not a very probable scenario.

== Orphaned products
See main risks. Basically the engagement of all stakeholders (Credit Suisse, JUGs, other companies) should ensure
this initiative will evolve hopefully rather quickly to a key component in the Java eco-system, both in SE, as well as ME
and EE. Additionally all stakeholders involved (companies, as well as individuals/JUGs) have direct benefits of the
functionality provided.

== Inexperience with Open Source
Starting point will be the experimental repository at https://github.com/java-config. Additionally the talks given by
Anatole (e.g. at Javaone 2014) and the blogs under http://javaeeconfig.blogspot.com help to give a good starting point
on many of the concepts implemented/contributed. Nevertheless the idea is that the ideas are further evolved, basically
similar to a JSR, to ensure all relevant views and aspects will be included.

All of the core committers have already experience working on open source projects or JSRs. Many of them even already
are members of the ASF.

== Homogenous Developers
The current list of committers includes developers from several
different companies plus many independent volunteers. The committers
are geographically distributed across the U.S., Brazil, Europe, and Asia.
They are experienced with working in a distributed environment.

== Reliance on Salaried Developers
Some of the developers are paid partially by their employer to contribute to
this project, but given the anticipation from the Java community for
a powerful Configuration implementation and the committers' sense of
ownership for the code, the project would continue without issue if no
salaried developers contributed to the project. Anatole, as the main
committer and driver of the initiative currently, is paid only partially
and basically drives the initiative as part of his community engagement
in general.

== Relationships with Other Apache Products
The project's core API will be independent of any other projects, since in the future it may
be part of a specification initiative (JSR). Additionally implementations may also have further
constraints (e.g. a ME implementation must consider memory consumption and a reduced set of
APIs available in the platform).
Extension modules, such as integrations with other technologies/projects, of course, will depend on further elements.
Where useful, adapter module can be provided, so the solution can inter-operate with existing configuration frameworks
and solutions such as
such as
* Apache Commons Configuration
* Spring Property Sources
* JFig
* Configuration Builder
* and more

This explicitly also includes the possibitliy to use {name} as a configuration/property source for other frameworks, e.g.
* Spring Property Source
* System Properties
* ...

Integration into Java EE has to be coordinated with Apache Deltaspike Configuration, to avoid having two
configuration standards.

== An Excessive Fascination with the Apache Brand
While we expect the Apache brand may help attract more contributors,
our interests is in establishing a powerful and widely used standard
for configuration. At a later stage, if successful, standardizing it
within a JSR also may be an option.
Especially we are interested in joining the ASF in order to increase
our contacts and visibility. Furthermore, we have been enthusiastic users
of Apache and feel honored at getting the opportunity to join.

== Initial Source
Initial source will be from https://github.com/java-config . Most of the functionalities are already fully functional,
documentation must be improved.

It is already licensed under Apache v2.


== External Dependencies
The API part of the current initial source is completely standalone (it does not have any firther dependencies than the JDK).
The SE 8 based part does mainly depend on sl4j for logging and javax.inject v.1.2. It uses Weld SE for testing.


== Cryptography
The framework will not bring along additional cryptographic algorithms.

== Required Resources
The project's build currently is based on Maven, it might be moved to gradle.

== Mailing lists
We initially would like to start with the minimum required lists:

* +private@{name}.incubator.apache.org+ will be used for confidential PPMC discussions.
* +dev@{name}.incubator.apache.org+ is used for public discussions and support.
* Commits for {name} will be emailed to +commits@{name}.incubator.apache.org+.
